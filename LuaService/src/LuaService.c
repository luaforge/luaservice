 * \todo Supporting service PAUSE and CONTINUE control request will
 * require some effort beyond the bare framework guarded by the 
 * undefined macro LUASERVICE_CAN_PAUSE_CONTINUE. At minimum, 
 * some mechanism must be provided for the Lua side to become
 * aware of the request and actually pause; presumably an Event
 * could be waited on to implement the pause, and signaled to 
 * implement continue. However, since we assume that the Lua 
 * interpreter itself is not built for threading, we don't have
 * a good means to asynchronously notify the Lua code of the 
 * pause request in the first place, which would imply that the
 * Lua code is constantly polling.
